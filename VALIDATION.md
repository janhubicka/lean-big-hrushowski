Manuscript: The-big-Hrushovski (v52). First milestone: finite predimensions.

| Manuscript statement | Lean declaration | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition of graph predimension and submodularity (Sections 1–2) | BigHrushovski.FiniteGraph.predim_submodular | Verified — [7-declaration audit](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/actions/runs/37976439415) |
| Intersection of finite strong substructures (Lemma intersection, first assertion) | BigHrushovski.Predimension.strong_inter | Verified — [7-declaration audit](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/actions/runs/37976439415) |
| Transitivity of finite strong substructures | BigHrushovski.Predimension.strong_trans | Verified — [7-declaration audit](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/actions/runs/37976439415) |
| Strict d-closure implies self-sufficiency | BigHrushovski.Predimension.strong_of_dClosed | Verified — [7-declaration audit](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/actions/runs/37976439415) |
| Finite strong hull of X in M_0 (Lemma intersection, second assertion) | None | Open |
| Equality with model-theoretic algebraic closure | None | Open |
| Enumeration, lifting, Ramsey and Ellentuck theorems | None | Open |

Only the finite-set statements listed here are formalized. The first assertion
of the intersection lemma is stronger than needed, because the general abstract
predimension theorem is instantiated by the *proved* submodularity of graph δ.

Audited Lean commit: [1a4dfafc](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/commit/1a4dfafc983305b28f0489ee727d62dd8f2315fa).
The [successful GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/janhubicka/lean-big-hrushowski/actions/runs/37976439415) built all modules and checked seven declarations, with only Lean's standard logical axioms and no placeholders.

Green marks require a successful build, exact theorem match, and axiom audit
of a pinned commit. Orange indicates partial coverage; blue is an interface
marker. A build still pending cannot be called machine verified.

Adversarial review perspectives:
1. Predimension: check each unordered edge counted once and direction of inequality.
2. Closure: distinguish strong-in-finite-C from strong-in-M, and finite hull existence.
3. Ramsey: never promote the finite predicate lemmas to recurrence or exact big degrees.
4. Lean: inspect elaborated theorem types, axioms, and forbidden placeholders.

These are separate hostile checking perspectives, not human referee certification.
